    "text": "A Childhood Dream\nWhen I was nine years old, I told my father that I wanted to be remembered even after I was gone. He said, “Yazeed, if you want to be remembered, you need to make a difference for the next generation.” Those words stayed with me and helped shape my goals. They are one of the reasons I chose to travel far from home to study sustainability and try to make the world a better place."

    "text": "From Medicine to Ecosystems\nAt first, I studied medicine. I believed that becoming a doctor was the best way to help people. However, during my fourth semester, I started to think differently. I realized that health is not just about medicine; it is also about the environment we live in. That is when I became more interested in climate change and sustainability. This new passion led me to Colorado State University."

    "text": "Studying at Colorado State University\nI grew up in a region where the oil industry has a big impact. I saw how energy production affects both people and the environment. Because of that, I wanted to learn how we can reduce carbon emissions while still meeting energy needs. I received a government scholarship to study Ecosystem Science and Sustainability at Colorado State University.\nBeing an international student came with challenges. I had to adjust to a new country, a new culture, and a different academic system. However, these challenges also gave me a new point of view and helped me grow."

    "text": "My Research in SUPER\n\nPhoto by James Wainscoat on Unsplash\nDuring the Skills for Undergraduate Participation in Ecological Research (SUPER) program, I joined a research team in the Kelp Lab, part of the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology. The program is hosted by the Department of Ecosystem Science and Sustainability, and you can learn more about it here.\n\nI first heard about SUPER from a class announcement, and my academic advisor encouraged me to apply since I am interested in research and planning to go to graduate school. After applying, I was fortunate to be mentored by Shelby Cagle, a PhD candidate who studies emerging infectious diseases using a One Health approach and specializes in science communication and virology.\nAs a student in the program, I worked on a science communication project that focused on public opinions about Colorado State University’s new bat research facility. We analyzed social media posts to understand how people feel about topics such as biosafety, research transparency, and diseases that can spread from animals to humans.\nThis was my first time doing a project focused on science communication, and it gave me a new way to think about the role of scientists. In addition to our research, I completed a formal research report, presented my poster at the CURC showcase , and wrote this blog as a final reflection piece. Each of which helped me grow as a communicator."

    "text": "What I Learned\nI never expected to study social media posts as part of my science education. However, this project showed me how important it is for scientists to connect with the public. I learned how to organize information, find patterns, and explain science in a way that is easier for others to understand.\n\n“Through my journey, I have learned that science is not just about numbers and experiments; it is also about listening and building trust.”"

Whether I am working on reducing carbon emissions or supporting environmental policies, I want to keep using the communication skills I developed in this program.\nBeing part of this program also reminded me how powerful our individual stories can be. As an international student, I learned to speak up, ask questions, and see my background as something valuable."
